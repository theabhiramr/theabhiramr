        This is my virtual pet Aria (based on my actual dog, Aria). She has several different moods that change based on how you interact with her.

    <h2>
        <b>Inputs:</b>
    </h2>

    <p>
        There are many different ways that you can interact with her, but be careful about what she wants, because you DO NOT 
        want to activate her Menace mood!
        <ul>
            <li>Play (P)</li>
            <li>Pet (E)</li>
            <li>Chase (C)</li>
            <li>Feed (F)</li>
            <li>Put to bed (B)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>
        <b>Excited (0):</b>
    </h2>

    <p>
        When you first see her, she will obviously be quite excited to see you. You can either play with her, pet her, chase her
        or feed her. You shouldn't put her to bed though, as it would be quite rude to make someone who is excited to see you 
        sleep. If you play with her, she will eventually get exhausted and be calm. However, if you pet her or feed her, she will
        have more energy and will want you to play with her. If you chase her, though, she will have no energy and needs to be 
        fed. But by all means, do not ignore her because she will be a menace! 
    </p>

    <h2>
        <b>Playful (1):</b>
    </h2>

    <p>
        One thing that Aria loves is to play. So obviously, if you play with her or chase her, she will be happy, but she will 
        eventually get exhausted and become hungry. If you simply pet her, she will be happy, but it is not enough to satisfy 
        her playful mood. If you feed her, she will go back to being excited (she does get very distracted). Once again, you 
        do not want to put her to bed or ignore her, because she will be menacing.
    </p>

    <h2>
        <b>Hungry (2):</b>
    </h2>

    <p>
        It is really quite simple. Feed her, or she will become a menace. If you ignore her or do anything else, you have 
        sealed your fate. 
    </p>

    <h2>
        <b>Calm (3):</b>
    </h2>

    <p>
        Aria becomes calm when she starts feeling tired, so the best course of action here is to just put her to bed. If you 
        play with her, pet her or feed her, she won't react because she has had enough fun playing with you. However, it 
        would be quite rude to chase her in this state. She will eventually become sleepy, however and she can sleep 
        anywhere (one of the few times she doesn't mind being ignored).
    </p>

    <h2>
        <b>Sleepy (4):</b>
    </h2>

    <p>
        This is when she is done playing or being chased and just wants to sleep. She doesn't mind if you pet her, but if you 
        annoy her too much, she will become a menace. However, if you try to put her to bed again, or feed her, then she will 
        become excited again. If you do nothing after a while, she will become excited again.
    </p>

    <h2>
        <b>Menace (5-9):</b>
    </h2>

    <p>
        This is the one mood that you do not want Aria to be in. Based on what action triggered this mode, there's only a few ways to get her out of this mode.
        <ul>
            <li>From Excited (5)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Fortunately, there are many ways that you can get her out of this mode. She is angry that you are not giving her attention, so if you 
                        play with her, pet her, chase her or feed her, she will go back to being excited. But if you put her to bed or ignore her, she will be 
                        sure to let you know that she only wants attention.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>From Playful (6)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Much like 5, here you can get her out of menace mode by interacting with her in some way, and she will become excited again.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>From Hungry (7)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        As mentioned before, here she is angry because you aren't feeding her. Feed her, and she will become excited again. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>From Calm (8)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In this case, she is mad that you chased her and now wants to go to bed. If you put her to bed or feed her, she will become sleepy.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>From Sleepy (9)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Here, she is mad that you interrupted her sleep. The only way to get her out of menace mode is to put her to bed and wait for her to 
                        finish sleeping (or you can feed her if you are bored).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>
        <b>Timers:</b>
    </h2>

    <p>
        As mentioned before, if Aria is inactive, she can either become a menace, sleepy or excited. Here are the specific times that affect her:
        <ul>
            <li>Excited (0) - Becomes menace (5) after 30 seconds of inactivity</li>
            <li>Playful (1) - Becomes menace (6) after 15 seconds of inactivity</li>
            <li>Hungry (2) - Becomes menace (7) after 20 seconds of inactivity</li>
            <li>Calm (3) - Becomes sleepy (4) after 20 seconds of inactivity</li>
            <li>Sleepy (4) - Becomes excited (0) after 30 seconds of inactivity</li>
            <li>Menace (5-9) - Prompts you to do an action after 5 seconds of inactivity</li>
        </ul>
        Every time you do an action, these timers reset.
    </p>

    <h2>
        <b>State Table:</b>

    <p>
        You can also use this handy state table to find out how to prevent her from being a menace (or make her if you are sadistic enough).
